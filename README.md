# MyWebsite

Welcome to math.eus website! This project is built with React and incorporates various features such as CI/CD using GitHub Actions and i18n automation with machine learning powered by Tolgee.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development

Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the website [locally](http://localhost:5173), allowing you to make changes and see them in real-time.

### Production Build

To build the production-ready version of the website, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory.

## CI/CD

The repository utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. With each push or pull request, the configured workflow automatically builds and deploys the latest changes to the live environment.

## i18n Automation

We have implemented i18n automation using Tolgee, a powerful tool for managing translations. By leveraging machine learning, we have streamlined the internationalization process to provide a seamless multilingual experience for our users.
